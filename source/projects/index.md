## My Projects


So, I'm a bit of a polymath, in that I do a wide variety of things, mostly for fun. I'm a web developer (I'm working mainly with Vue.js at this point, though this site was made with Hexo, and I maintain/help maintain a few sites made in Jekyll, and I have a bit of experience with Hugo, so there.), a coder, a writer, a roboticist, a food experimenter, a designer, you probably get the point. Below is a list of skills I have that I felt were worth mentioning.

*Disclaimer:* I don't guarantee that any of these external links work/are safe (though, hopefully at least my own websites are...). Use them at your own risk!

2134 – Security and Enforcement – My new in-progress novel. The year is 2134. Humanity is at peace, thanks to the Global Security and Enforcement Corporation. In fact, since war was declared illegal fifty years previous, humankind has been able to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.
