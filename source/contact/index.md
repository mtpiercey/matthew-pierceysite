Currently, I’m at Trent University in Peterborough studying towards a BBA with an emphasis in Information Systems and E-commerce.

I’m always willing to learn something new, expand my professional portfolio, and try new things (especially foods; I’m apparently rather adventurous when it comes to my culinary tastes).

I’m likely too "busy"/forgetful to post regular updates on my website, but I’m always willing to make new connections. Drop me a line at [matthew@botinabox.ca](mailto:matthew@botinabox.ca) or on (*ugh*) Facebook, and I’ll reply shortly.
